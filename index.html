    <h1><font size="+3">Secrets of </font>Friedrich Lüling </h1>
    <h2><u><font size="+2">Preamble</font></u></h2>
    Friedrich Lüling has presented two of his Inventions in the UFA
    Newsreel 498 in 1966.<br>
    These two so called Lüling Motors are supposed to be Magnet driven
    Engines. Even If<br>
    we see only one of his two Engines running, it is implied that both
    of it are capable of running<br>
    by its own. There is little to nothing really known about the Person
    itself nor the details<br>
    about the mechanics, the tech and the Physics.<br>
    <br>
    I started my own private Research-Study about Mr. Friedrich Lüling,
    his Motors and its feasibility. It took<br>
    my over a Year to get a much higher Scan (almost 4K) of a 35mm UFA
    Newsreel Copy from the <br>
    German Federal Archives <a href="https://www.bundesarchiv.de">Bundesarchive</a>.<br>
    <br>
    I've managed to get a Permission to work with this Footage for my
    research and keep it public by preserving<br>
    the Copyrights from the Bundesarchive. Unfortunately they are no
    Metadata available that could proof if<br>
    the Person was Real or Fake. But the High Resolution Black and White
    Footage revealed some details<br>
    we have never seen before. This Project will be a collection of
    these Findings and a call for you to proof me<br>
    wrong. In order to create an identically base of information's, the
    4K Footage is available as a Video (.mkv)<br>
    and its Frames. The Idea is to motivate People to search, find and
    reveal more Secretes of Friedrich Lüling.<br>
